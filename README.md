# 🧠 **FedEdge v1.0.1 (Beta)**
### *Decentralized AI Copilot for Crypto, DeFi, and Beyond*

**FedEdge** is an **AI-powered cryptocurrency and DeFi copilot** that combines **real-time market intelligence**, **autonomous trading agents**, and **federated learning on edge devices** — bringing privacy-preserving intelligence to every user.

Built for traders, researchers, and AI enthusiasts, FedEdge offers:

- ⚙️ **Autonomous trading orchestration** — from signal detection to execution and PnL tracking.  
- 📊 **Real-time analytics & portfolio insights** powered by local AI reasoning.  
- 🤖 **Multi-agent architecture** *(Planner, Executor, Critic)* for adaptive decision-making.  
- 🔗 **Federated Learning on Edge Devices** — each device contributes to global intelligence while preserving privacy.  
- 🧩 **DeFi & Smart Contract analysis** *(in progress)* — future AI tools to interpret and reason about blockchain data.  
- 💡 **Local-first design** — all intelligence runs on your hardware *(Jetson, Raspberry Pi, PC…)* for maximum sovereignty.

> **FedEdge** is building the first open platform merging **AI trading agents**, **federated learning**, and **blockchain governance**, enabling a new era of **shared intelligence — privately trained, collectively improved.**
